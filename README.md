Apply a pre-trained ResNet50 model to the Flowers Dataset: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/

Some tutorials and links that helped me:

Basic Pytorch Tutorial on Transfer Learning: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html

Kaggle Review on Models classifying Flowers 102 Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/oxford-102-flower-pytorch

Data/Labels were acquired from this Github Repo: https://github.com/intsco/udacity-fb-pytorch-project

It seems that Udacity used to have a tutorial for this same task using a Vgg19 model but its no longer available.
